```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Objective

Plot data on the closing values of major EU stock market indices (EuStockMarkets in datasets package) for a user-selected date range.

Future planned enhancements: (i) allow import of alternative time series, rather than hard-coding EuStockMarkets; (ii) rebase allplotted indices to same starting point to show relative performance.

---

## Approach

Slider used to select start and end period of the date range.

---

## Example 1: Full data set

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(datasets)
eusm <- EuStockMarkets
plot(eusm, plot.type = "single", col = 1:4, main = "Plot of indices for selected time period", ylab = "Index value")
```

---

## Example 2: Restricted data range

```{r echo = FALSE}
plot(eusm, plot.type = "single", col = 1:4, main = "Plot of indices for selected time period", ylab = "Index value", xlim = c(1994, 1995))
```
