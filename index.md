## Objective

Plot data on the closing values of major EU stock market indices (EuStockMarkets in datasets package) for a user-selected date range.

Future planned enhancements: (i) allow import of alternative time series, rather than hard-coding EuStockMarkets; (ii) rebase allplotted indices to same starting point to show relative performance.

---

## Approach

Slider used to select start and end period of the date range.
